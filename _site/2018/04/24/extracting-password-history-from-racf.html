<h1>Extracting password history from RACF</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim</p>

<p>With thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kholia">Dhiru Kholia</a>, who was able to tidy up the ‚Äúmystery‚Äù <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/848a5219560b18989fcf878e1df034d2">racf_debug.c program</a>, it is possible to extract old passwords for IDs from a RACF database. Unfortunately this is one downside to having an extensive password history enabled on a system - e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SETROPTS HISTORY(12)</code> means that 12 old passwords are retained in the RACF database to ensure users do not re-use their passwords. It also means that all 12 password hashes are also stored‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why would you want the old hashes?
<strong>A:</strong> Why not? üòÉ Apart from idle curiosity, a genuine use would be to track password patterns used which could allow you to predict future passwords for an ID</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Save the <a href="https://github.com/lnlyssg/zos/blob/master/racf_debug_cleanup.c">code</a> to your PC (or clone the repo if you prefer)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a Unix-like system, compile and run it (if using macOS you will need to have Xcode and the command line tools installed to use gcc): <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc racf-debug-cleanup.c -o racf-debug-cleanup; ./racf-debug-cleanup
SYS1.RACFDB  | grep '\$racf' &gt; hashes.txt</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the resulting hashes.txt file in <a href="/2018/04/24/hashcat-commands-for-racf-passwords.html">hashcat</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>
